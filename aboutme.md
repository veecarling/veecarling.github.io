I am a fifth-year student and research assistant at University of California, Riverside, pursuing a bachelors in Physics. My laboratory experience consists of both team-based and independent research projects in experimental condensed matter physics during my time in university, as well as microbiology prior.

With additional internship, lab, and industry experience, I hope to continue in the field of condensed matter physics or materials science & engineering. You can find my CV [**here**](assets/files/Vanessa_Kwong_CV.pdf).
