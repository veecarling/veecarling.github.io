I am a fifth-year student and research assistant at University of California, Riverside, pursuing a bachelors in Physics. My laboratory experience consists of both team-based and independent research projects in experimental condensed matter physics during my time in university, as well as microbiology prior.

With additional internship, lab, and industry experience, I hope to continue in the field of condensed matter physics or materials science & engineering. You can find my CV [**here**](assets/files/Vanessa_Kwong_CV.pdf).

My first three years in university was spent towards a degree in biology on a pre-medicine route, aiming to work in forensic pathology. I was captivated by its problem-solving and research implementation into the field of medicine. By the beginning of my fourth year, I had found great interest in being on the forefront of research and studying processes and interactions at an atomic level--the very studies that can advance technology to solve problems in any field. I was fascinated by the vast impact studies on such small systems can have. Through initially declaring a minor in physics, I explored specific fields of physics through various upper-division courses and research, eventually switching to the major.

Having pivoted from an academic and research background in biological sciences, I have a profound interest in multidisciplinary research and a desire to help in overcoming conventionally steep learning curves.
