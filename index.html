<h1>Hello!</h1>
I am a fifth-year undergraduate student and researcher at University of California, Riverside, pursuing a bachelors in Physics.
<br><br>
I look forward to additional research involvement and higher education in condensed matter physics or materials science / engineering, and potentially patent law dealing with semiconductor. 
Please find my curriculum vitae <a href="assets/files/Vanessa_Kwong_CV.pdf"><b>here</b></a>.

<br><br>
<h3>Research Experience & Interests</h3>
In my final years of my undergraduate degree, I have been working as a researcher in experimental condensed matter at <a href="https://joelab.ucr.edu/"><b>The Joe Lab</b></a> 
under the <a href="https://www.physics.ucr.edu/"><b>Department of Physics and Astronomy</b></a>, focusing on transport and optical properties of two-dimensional materials within heterostructure devices.

<br><br>
Through extensive laboratory and research experience, I have become an adaptable and dedicated researcher, especially driven by my fascination and curiosity to understand and expand 
the novelty in science behind modern technological advancements.
<br><br>
Having pivoted from an academic and research background in biological sciences, I have a profound interest in multidisciplinary research and a desire to help in overcoming 
conventionally steep learning curves.

<!--My first three years in university was spent towards a degree in biology on a pre-medicine route. By the beginning of my fourth year, I had found even greater 
interest in being on the forefront of research and studying these processes and interactions at an atomic level. Through initially declaring a minor in physics, 
I explored specific fields of physics through various upper-division courses and research, eventually switching to the major.
