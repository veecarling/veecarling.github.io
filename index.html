<h1>About Me</h1>
I am a fifth-year student and research assistant at University of California, Riverside, pursuing a bachelors in Physics.
<br><br>
With additional internship, lab, and industry experiences, I hope to continue in the field of condensed matter physics, materials science & engineering, or 
a related area of study. You can find my CV <a href="assets/files/Vanessa_Kwong_CV.pdf"><b>here</b></a>.

My first three years in university was spent towards a degree in biology on a pre-medicine route. By the beginning of my fourth year, I had found even greater 
interest in being on the forefront of research and studying these processes and interactions at an atomic level. Through initially declaring a minor in physics, 
I explored specific fields of physics through various upper-division courses and research, eventually switching to the major.

<h2>Research Experience & Interests</h2>
In my final years of my undergraduate degree, I have been working as an undergraduate researcher in experimental condensed matter at <a href="https://joelab.ucr.edu/"><b>The Joe Lab</b></a>, focusing on 
transport and optical properties of two-dimensional materials within heterostructure devices.

<br><br>
Through extensive laboratory and research experience, I have become an adaptable and dedicated researcher, especially driven by my fascination and curiosity to understand and expand 
the novelty in science behind modern technological advancements.
<br><br>
Having pivoted from an academic and research background in biological sciences, I have a profound interest in multidisciplinary research and a desire to help in overcoming 
conventionally steep learning curves.
