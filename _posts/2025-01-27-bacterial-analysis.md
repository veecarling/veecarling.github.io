This project was completed for an evaluation of 3rd place Senior Microbiology Research Award at the **2018 Los Angeles County Science and Engineering Fair**,in representation of [**Glen A. Wilson High School**](https://wihs.hlpschools.org/).

Bacterial counts, spectrophotometry of serial dilutions, and data analyses are done for glove materials latex, nitrile, and vinyl to determine their effectiveness in preventing bacterial penetration in everyday use.
