                        Studies of two-dimensional (2D) Van der Waals (VdW) heterostructure devices have contributed significantly to novel optoelectronics advancements and correlated 
                        quantum states at the atomic scale. WSe₂, a semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD), has a direct bandgap when reduced to a monolayer, and can be 
                        used for both optical and electrical measurements. However, a lack of reliable, low resistance electrical contacts to semiconducting 2D materials has hindered 
                        careful electron transport studies and further development of optoelectronic devices. Here, we aim to develop reliable, Ohmic contacts by using pre-patterned 
                        platinum contacts for p-type WSe₂ monolayers. Bulk graphite, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), and WSe₂ are mechanically exfoliated and stacked by dry transfer. 
                        We fabricate h-BN encapsulated monolayer WSe₂ with dual graphite gates, allowing independent doping of the contact areas and the WSe₂ channel. After designing 
                        and evaporating platinum Hall bar contacts using electron beam lithography and evaporation, we first demonstrate reliable doping of WSe₂ through photoluminescence 
                        measurements to observe exciton and trion formation, then take transport measurements at low temperatures (1.7 K) to extract the contact resistance and linearity of 
                        the contact response. The development of low temperature contacts will open up the possibility to measure Quantum Hall states with observable Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) 
                        oscillations and other quantum structures such as electrically controlled quantum dots and correlated states in TMD twisted heterostructures. Going forward, we will 
                        try to develop contacts for other TMD materials to expand the available 2D materials for electronic studies and the development of efficient, silicon-based devices 
                        among modern electronics.

                        Silicon-based semiconductor devices have come to make many modern technological advances including transistors and photodetectors.  
                        Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals materials are of interest for fabricating even smaller devices because they can be mechanically 
                        exfoliated to the atomically-thin limit.  One class of such materials, monolayer semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), 
                        are of particular interest for optoelectronic device applications due to their direct band gap.  Due to their spin-valley locking, TMDs 
                        can make use of the additional valley degree of freedom.  We will first isolate thin flakes from bulk crystals using mechanical exfoliation.  
                        Then we will stack these exfoliated flakes to create electrically controllable 2D devices. Finally, we will optically characterize the 
                        electrically controllable WSe₂ and MoSe₂ monolayer transistor devices at room and cryogenic temperatures.  These devices will serve as the 
                        basis for designing novel valleytronic devices, where photons can be stored and manipulated in both the spin and valley states.  
                        Furthermore, we can combine different TMDs with relative 
                        twisting angles to create moiré devices that can host correlated states such as Mott insulators and superconductors.
