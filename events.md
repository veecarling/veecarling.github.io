## Pulsed Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
*Nov. 2024 - Dec. 2024*

This project was finished in fulfillment for the capstone laboratory course , **PHYS 142W**, at UC Riverside.

Pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance (PNMR) is a method used to determine the magnetic moment of nuclei, finding their distinct energy levels based on their nucleus spin and splitting. Deriving from the original nuclear magnetic resonance method, PNMR implements oscillating eleectromagnetic fields as short pulses of radio frequency signals.

In this experiment, we measue resonant frequencies with PNMR. Each of the tested liquid samples—water, glycerin, and two concentrations of Fe3+ ionized solutions—contains protons in the nuclei which are measured for their collective resonant adsorption, determined by the finel tuned resonant condition. This is done through observation of the free induction decay, or FID, telling the different relaxations of the spin-spin relaxation (T1) and spin-lattice relaxation (T2)—which we can use to calculate magnetic moments of the nuclei.
